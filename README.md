# AI-Driven Crop Disease Detection Tool - Assignment 6

## Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for Assignment 6, which focuses on applying Agile methodologies to the development of an AI-driven crop disease detection tool for South Africa's agricultural sector. The primary goal is to translate project requirements into actionable user stories, prioritize them in a product backlog, and plan the initial sprint for the project.

## Project Goal

The overall project aims to develop an AI-powered tool using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect crop diseases in real-time, addressing challenges such as food security, crop yield reduction, and the digital divide in agriculture. This assignment specifically addresses the initial Agile planning phase.

## Contents

This repository includes the following files:

*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the assignment and repository contents.
*   **`user_stories.md`**: A table of user stories derived from functional requirements and use cases, outlining the needs and expectations of various stakeholders.
*   **`product_backlog.md`**: A prioritized product backlog, using MoSCoW prioritization (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to rank user stories based on their importance and urgency.
*   **`sprint_plan.md`**: A detailed plan for the first sprint, including the sprint goal, selected user stories, and specific tasks required to achieve the goal.
*   **`reflection.md`**: A reflection document detailing challenges encountered during the planning process and lessons learned.

## GitHub Agile Tools

This project utilizes GitHub's Agile tools to manage and track progress:

*   **Issues**: Each user story is represented as a GitHub issue, allowing for detailed discussion and tracking of its implementation.
*   **Projects**: A Kanban board is used to visualize the workflow, with columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Issues are moved across columns as progress is made.
*   **Milestones**: Sprints are defined as milestones with specific start and end dates. Issues are assigned to milestones to track progress within each sprint.

## Stakeholders
